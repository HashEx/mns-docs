Decentralized Zones
========

Zone Support
--------

MNS supports decentralized name zones:

- .bip
- .mnt

Whois
-------
You could lookup zone info via our web service https://mns.hashex.org.

Domain Registration
--------

New domain with length more than 6 symbols in decentralized zones **.bip** or **.mnt** costs 50 BIPs. 
Domains with length equal or less than 6 symbols are called Premium. See next section for Premium domain registration.
To register a new zone you need to send a transaction to **Mx** address with correct funds amount and with specified data field. 
We use our `MNS Standard<https://mns-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard.html>`_ for registration and zone updates. You could create data field manually or use our `web service<https://mns.hashex.org>`_ for this.

Premium Domains Registration
--------

Premium domain is a domain with length equal or less than 6 symbols, e.g. *hashex.mnt*. Rules and prices for Premium domains will be posted later.
