Minter Name System
========

Similar to any classic domain name system (`RFC-1034 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034>`_, `RFC-1035 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035>`_), MNS is supported by name servers. All decentralized zones data is stored in `Minter Network <https://minter.network>`_ blockchain. MNS has interoperability with classic DNS, so you could use our name servers for both zone types: classic and decentralized.

Zone Support
--------

We support decentralized zones **.bip** and **.mnt** and any other classic zones via DNS forwarding.

Usage
--------

Please configure your tcp/ip settings to use name server from the list:

- 138.201.209.67

Decentralization
--------

As of today, MNS is not totally decentralized. As we store data in the blockchain, we transfer this data via classical software. Basically this setup is satisfactory because data storing is fully decentralized, but we have plans to provide totally decentralized service via DNS integration into nodes. As we have more details, we will add them here.
