Minter Name System
========

MNS like a classical domain name system (`RFC-1034 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034>`_, [RFC-1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035)) is supported by name servers. All decentralized zones data is stored in [Minter Network](https://minter.network) blockchain. MNS has interoperability with classical DNS, so you could use our name servers for both zone types: classical and decentralized.

Zone Support
--------

We support decentralized zones **.bip** and **.mnt** and any other classical zones via DNS forwarding.

Usage
--------

Please configure your tcp/ip settings to use name server from the list:

- 138.201.209.67

Decentralization
--------

Just now we have not a total decentralized name system. As we store data in the blockchain, we transfer this data via classical software. Basically this is satisfactorily because data storing is fairy decentralized, but we have plans to provide totally decentralized service via dns integration into nodes. As we have more details, we will add them here.
